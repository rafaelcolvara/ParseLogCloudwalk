# Software Engineer test for Cloudwalk

 The intend is to create a LogParser for Quake 3 Arena server 
 (https://gist.github.com/cloudwalk-tests/704a555a0fe475ae0284ad9088e203f1)
 
 I used Java 18 with Maven and JUnit for testing purposes.

## How to use


 Clone this repository 
```
 git clone git@github.com:rafaelcolvara/ParseLogCloudwalk.git
```
 Compile 

```
mvn clean install
```
 and Run
``` 
java -jar target/ParseLogCloudwalk-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 

```



Enjoy ;)
